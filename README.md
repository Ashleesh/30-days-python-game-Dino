## ✨ Core Features & Gameplay Mechanics

This isn't just a static demonstration – it's a fully interactive gaming experience with carefully crafted mechanics:

### 🎮 Classic Endless Runner Experience
The game captures the essence of the original with a continuously scrolling desert landscape populated with challenging cactus obstacles. Your mission is straightforward yet addictive: guide your dinosaur through an endless obstacle course and survive for as long as possible while your score climbs higher with every passing moment.

### 🖱️ Intuitive Cross-Platform Controls
The control scheme is designed for universal accessibility:
- **Desktop Users:** Press the spacebar to make your dinosaur leap over obstacles
- **Mobile Users:** Simply tap anywhere on the screen to jump
- **Responsive Design:** The game automatically adapts to different screen sizes and input methods

### ⚗️ Realistic Physics Engine
A carefully tuned, gravity-based physics system governs the dinosaur's movement:
- **Natural Jump Mechanics:** The dinosaur follows realistic arc trajectories when jumping
- **Gravity Implementation:** A constant gravitational force pulls the character back to ground level
- **Velocity Control:** Jump height and descent speed are precisely calibrated for optimal gameplay

### 🌵 Dynamic Obstacle Generation
The challenge system keeps players engaged through:
- **Consistent Spawning:** Cacti appear at regular intervals to maintain steady difficulty
- **Predictable Movement:** Obstacles move at a fixed speed, allowing players to develop timing skills
- **Balanced Challenge:** The spacing and speed are fine-tuned to be challenging but fair

### 💥 Precise Collision Detection
The game employs a reliable bounding box algorithm:
- **Accurate Hit Detection:** Collisions are detected when the dinosaur and cactus sprites overlap
- **Immediate Game Over:** Upon collision, the game state instantly changes to display the final score
- **Visual Feedback:** Players receive clear indication when a collision occurs

### 📈 Real-Time Scoring System
The scoring mechanism provides continuous feedback:
- **Incremental Scoring:** Points accumulate automatically as time progresses
- **Persistent Display:** Current score is always visible during gameplay
- **Final Score Presentation:** The game over screen prominently displays your final achievement

### 🎨 Modern, Clean Design
The visual presentation combines retro gaming aesthetics with contemporary web design:
- **Tailwind CSS Integration:** All UI elements benefit from professional, responsive styling
- **HTML5 Canvas Rendering:** Game graphics are rendered on a dedicated canvas element for smooth performance
- **Retro Gaming Feel:** Pixel-perfect sprites and classic color schemes evoke nostalgia
- **Responsive Interface:** The design works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices

### 🔧 File Responsibilities Explained

**app.py - The Backend Foundation**
This minimal Python script serves as the application's backbone. It initializes a Flask web server and defines a single route that renders the main game page. This file acts as the crucial bridge between incoming web requests and the game's frontend presentation.

**templates/index.html - The Complete Frontend**
This single, comprehensive file contains the entire user interface:

- **HTML Structure:** Defines the document layout including the canvas element for game rendering and hidden div elements for start and game over screens
- **CSS Styling:** Includes both custom styles and Tailwind CSS integration for professional, responsive design
- **JavaScript Game Logic:** Contains the complete game engine including:
  - Asset loading with comprehensive error handling
  - Main game loop with physics calculations and rendering
  - Collision detection algorithms
  - Event handling for keyboard and touch input
  - Game state management and transitions

**static/assets/ - Essential Game Resources**
Flask automatically serves files from the static directory, making them accessible to the browser:

- **dino-sprite.jpg:** The main character's sprite sheet containing animation frames
- **cactus-small.png:** The primary obstacle graphic used throughout gameplay
- **cloud.png:** Background decoration element for visual interest
- **ground.jpg:** Repeating texture that creates the scrolling desert floor effect

**highscore.json - Future Enhancement Placeholder**
Currently unused file intended for persistent high score storage in future versions of the game.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

When issues arise, these solutions address the most common problems:

### Python and Flask Issues

**Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'Flask'`
- **Cause:** Flask is not installed in your Python environment
- **Solution:** Run `pip install Flask` or `pip3 install Flask`
- **Verification:** Run `pip list` to confirm Flask appears in installed packages

**Error:** `python: command not found` (macOS/Linux)
- **Cause:** Python is not installed or not in your system PATH
- **Solution:** Try `python3 app.py` instead, or install Python from python.org

**Error:** Server starts but can't access via browser
- **Cause:** Firewall blocking the port or incorrect URL
- **Solution:** Try `http://localhost:5000` instead of `127.0.0.1:5000`

### Game Loading Issues

**Problem:** Blank canvas or broken images
- **Cause:** Image files missing or incorrect file paths
- **Solution:** 
  1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
  2. Check the Console tab for 404 errors
  3. Verify all files in `static/assets/` match the names in the code
  4. Ensure file extensions are correct (.jpg vs .png)

**Problem:** "Start Game" button doesn't respond
- **Cause:** JavaScript asset loading failure
- **Solution:**
  1. Check browser console for error messages
  2. Verify all image files are present in `static/assets/`
  3. Confirm file names exactly match those referenced in `index.html`
  4. Clear browser cache and reload the page

**Problem:** Game runs but controls don't work
- **Cause:** JavaScript event listeners not properly attached
- **Solution:**
  1. Refresh the page completely
  2. Check if the canvas element is properly focused (click on it)
  3. Try both keyboard and touch controls to isolate the issue

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** Choppy or slow animation
- **Cause:** Browser performance or resource limitations
- **Solution:**
  1. Close other browser tabs to free up memory
  2. Try a different browser (Chrome typically performs best)
  3. Check if other applications are using significant system resources

**Problem:** Game crashes after extended play
- **Cause:** Memory leak in the game loop
- **Solution:**
  1. Refresh the page to reset the game state
  2. This is a known limitation of the current implementation

### Network Access Issues

**Problem:** Other devices can't access the game
- **Cause:** Flask running in localhost-only mode
- **Solution:** Modify `app.py` to use `app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)` for network access

## 🔍 Code Structure Deep Dive

### Game Loop Architecture

The heart of the game lies in the JavaScript game loop, which follows this pattern:

1. **Update Phase:** Calculate physics, move objects, check collisions
2. **Render Phase:** Clear canvas and redraw all game elements
3. **Timing Control:** Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps performance

### State Management

The game maintains distinct states:
- **Loading:** Assets are being downloaded and initialized
- **Start Screen:** Waiting for player to begin
- **Playing:** Active gameplay with physics and collision detection
- **Game Over:** Display final score and restart option

### Asset Management

Images are preloaded and cached for optimal performance:
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation if images fail to load
- **Loading Feedback:** Visual indicators during asset initialization
- **Caching Strategy:** Browser automatically caches loaded images
